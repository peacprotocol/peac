# PEAC Protocol Governance

## Purpose

This document describes the governance structure for the PEAC Protocol project, including decision-making processes, roles, and the path to open governance.

## Current Stewardship

**Steward:** Originary (Poem, Inc.)

**Project Maintainer:** Jithin Raj

The steward is responsible for:

- Strategic direction and roadmap
- Release management and versioning
- Security vulnerability response
- Trademark and licensing oversight
- Community health and conduct enforcement

## Maintainers

Project maintainers are listed in the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS) file. Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues and discussions
- Ensuring code quality and test coverage
- Guiding technical decisions within their area
- Mentoring contributors

### Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainer status is earned through sustained, high-quality contributions. The process:

1. Demonstrate expertise through multiple merged PRs
2. Show commitment to code review and community support
3. Be nominated by an existing maintainer
4. Receive approval from the project maintainer

## Decision Process

### Day-to-Day Decisions

- Made by maintainers through PR review
- Consensus preferred; maintainer judgment when needed
- Document rationale in PR descriptions

### Significant Changes

For changes affecting protocol surface, wire format, or public APIs:

1. Open a GitHub issue describing the proposal
2. Allow 7 days for community feedback
3. Maintainers discuss and reach consensus
4. Document the decision and rationale

## Path to Open Governance

PEAC Protocol is committed to evolving toward neutral, multi-stakeholder governance as the project matures. The transition plan:

**Phase 1 (Current):** Steward-led development with open contribution

**Phase 2 (Post-v1.0):** Establish a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) with representation from major implementers and contributors

**Phase 3 (At Scale):** Evaluate foundation or consortium structure for long-term neutrality

Transition milestones will be driven by:

- Production deployments across multiple organizations
- Active contributor base beyond the founding team
- Demonstrated need for formal governance structure
