# PEAC Protocol Governance

To form a non-profit foundation (inspired by Let's Encrypt). The multi-stakeholder board represents publishers, AI firms, infra, OSS, and regulators to ensure no single interest dominates. A multi-stakeholder board including publishers, AI firms, infrastructure providers, OSS representatives, and regulators (e.g., IETF/W3C). Funding: Grants and a minimal 0.1% transaction fee (if/when payments are enabled), designed solely to prevent capture and ensure protocol neutrality.

Contribution Policies:

- PRs reviewed by board/community.
- Code of Conduct: Contributor Covenant (standard OSS).
- Decisions: Consensus-based for major changes.
