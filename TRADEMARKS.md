# PEAC Protocol Trademark Guidelines

These guidelines explain how to use the **PEAC Protocol** name and logos in a way that supports a healthy open ecosystem while preventing confusion about what is official.

PEAC Protocol is an open-source project. The **PEAC Protocol** name, **PEAC** name, and the PEAC logos (the "Marks") are trademarks of **Poem, Inc.**, used for the benefit of the PEAC Protocol project.

**Project stewardship:** Poem, Inc.
**Maintainer contact:** Jithin Raj
**Trademark contact:** <trademarks@peacprotocol.org>

These guidelines do **not** restrict your rights to use PEAC Protocol code under the Apache-2.0 license. They only cover trademark usage.

## 1. What trademarks are for

Trademarks exist to prevent user confusion (e.g., someone thinking your project is the official PEAC project, is endorsed by it, or is an official extension).

We want the opposite of "permissioned branding": you should be able to truthfully say you support PEAC Protocol, ship integrations, and build businesses around it, as long as you don't imply endorsement or official status.

## 2. You may use the Marks without permission (nominative + compatibility use)

You may use **PEAC Protocol** / **PEAC** to truthfully describe compatibility, implementation, or support, including:

- "Implements PEAC Protocol"
- "Compatible with PEAC Protocol"
- "Supports PEAC receipts"
- "Built to work with PEAC Protocol"
- "PEAC adapter / PEAC middleware / PEAC client"

You may also use the Marks in documentation, blog posts, talks, benchmarks, and comparisons.

### Open-source package/repo naming (permitted)

You may use "peac" in OSS package or repository names _when it is clearly descriptive_ and does not imply official status.

Good examples:

- `acme-peac-adapter`
- `peac-otel-exporter` (community plugin)
- `peac-go` (language binding with clear attribution/disclaimer)
- `peac-middleware-fastify`

Not good (implies official):

- `peac-official-sdk`
- `peac-core-team`
- `the-peac-protocol`

If there's any ambiguity, add a short disclaimer in the README (see Section 6).

### Logo use for compatibility (permitted with rules)

You may use an **unmodified** PEAC logo to indicate compatibility or support (e.g., "Works with PEAC Protocol"), provided that:

- You do not modify, distort, recolor, or animate the logo in a way that changes its appearance
- Your use does not suggest sponsorship, endorsement, or official status
- Your branding is visually dominant over the PEAC logo (PEAC should not be the primary brand)

(If you need official "certified" branding, see Section 4.)

## 3. You may not use the Marks in a confusing way

You may not:

- Use the Marks in a way that implies your product, company, or service is **official**, **endorsed**, **sponsored**, or **approved** by the PEAC Protocol project or Poem, Inc.
- Use the Marks as the primary name/logo for your product or company
- Use the PEAC logos in a modified form, or create confusingly similar logos
- Use "Official", "Certified", "Partner", or similar terms with the Marks unless you have written permission

Examples that are **not allowed** without permission:

- "PEAC Payments Inc."
- "Official PEAC SDK" (when not published by the PEAC project)
- "PEAC Certified Gateway" (without a certification agreement)
- A logo that imitates the PEAC logo style closely enough to confuse users

## 4. Uses that require permission

Please contact <contact@peacprotocol.org> for written permission if you want to:

- Use a PEAC logo as part of your product/company logo
- Use the Marks in paid marketing in a way that could suggest endorsement
- Run a "PEAC Certified" program, badge, or marketplace listing
- Use the Marks on physical merchandise
- Use the Marks in a domain name that is likely to confuse users (see below)

## 5. Domain names and social handles

We do not want to block community projects, but we do want to prevent confusing domains/handles.

### Allowed (generally)

- Domains/handles that clearly identify _your_ brand first and PEAC second, e.g.:
  - `acme-peac-tools.example`
  - `peac-tools-by-acme.example`
- Community projects that are clearly unofficial and include a disclaimer (Section 6)

### Not allowed (without permission)

- Domains/handles that appear official or ambiguous, such as:
  - `peacprotocol.*`
  - `peac.*` (when it looks like the official project)
  - Anything that suggests official status (e.g., `officialpeac.*`, `peac-certified.*`)

## 6. Suggested disclaimer for community projects

If you are a community project, plugin, or integration, add this to your README/site footer:

> PEAC Protocol is a trademark of Poem, Inc. This project is an independent community project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the PEAC Protocol project.

## 7. Questions and reporting

Questions or permission requests: <contact@peacprotocol.org>

If you believe a use of the Marks is confusing or misleading, please email <trademarks@peacprotocol.org> with links and a brief description.

## 8. Updates

These guidelines may change over time. The current version is the one in this repository.
