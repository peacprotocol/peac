# Compliance Guide (Informative)

PEAC helps express and honor policy: purposes, quotas, consent/privacy hints, attribution, and verifiable receipts.

**Policy keys (examples):**

- `purposes`, `rate_limit`, `free_quota`
- `attribution`, `privacy_policy`, `data_retention`
- `negotiate` (URL), `payment_adapters`

Receipts enable auditability; where payment is involved, settlement is adapter-based (x402 first, then any payment provider adapter).
