# PEAC Architecture

High-level architecture documentation for PEAC Protocol, including wire format design, protocol layering, performance characteristics, and the six-pillar framework.

**Status:** Content will be populated from the master plan over v0.9.16+

## Planned Coverage

- Wire format and envelope design
- Protocol layering (kernel, transport, control, rails)
- Performance targets and trade-offs
- Six-pillar architecture (Access, Attribution, Compliance, Consent, Intelligence, Infrastructure)
- Vendor neutrality principles

See [REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md) for current implementation roadmap.
