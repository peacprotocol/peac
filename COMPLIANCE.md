# PEAC Protocol Compliance Mappings

PEAC is designed to be compliant-ready, helping all stakeholders meet the requirements of global data, consent, and attribution regulations. PEAC ensures legal/ethical alignment for all agents.

| Regulation | PEAC Mapping |
|------------|--------------|
| EU AI Act | Provenance via logs/attribution; consent for data. |
| DMCA | Potential safe harbor through verifiable attribution/denials. |
| GDPR | Consent-based terms; privacy extensions. |
| India DPDP | Data protection mappings for fiduciaries. |
| China PIPL | Personal info alignment for AI. |
| W3C VCs | Verifiable credentials in extensions. |

## Dispute Resolution Guidance

PEACâ€™s compliance tools will expand to support verifiable on-chain and off-chain dispute resolution frameworks in future versions.

Suggested practices:

- Agents store proofs (see [spec.md](spec.md)
- Publishers expose contact email (already supported).
- Foundation may offer optional arbitration in v1.1+ via public GitHub repo or neutral process.

Disclaimer: This mapping is not legal advice. Always consult legal counsel before deploying in regulated environments.

Contribute mappings/PRs for new regs; building for the automated economy collaboratively.
