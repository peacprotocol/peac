## Security Measures

### Cryptographic Security
- EdDSA (Ed25519) signatures only
- JWS Compact Serialization
- Key rotation every 30 days
- Hardware security module support

### Input Validation
- Strict JSON schema validation
- SSRF protection on all external calls
- Rate limiting with token buckets
- Request size limits enforced

### Operational Security
- No secrets in code or commits
- Environment-based configuration
- Audit logging for security events
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All user input validated
- [ ] External URLs validated against SSRF
- [ ] Rate limiting considered
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Dependencies audited (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Security tests written for new features

## Known Security Considerations

### SSRF Protection
All crawler and verification endpoints implement SSRF guards:
- Private IP range blocking
- DNS rebinding protection
- Redirect limit enforcement
- Timeout controls

### DoS Prevention
- Token bucket rate limiting
- Request size limits
- Computation timeouts
- Circuit breakers for external services

### Data Privacy
- No PII in logs
- Structured telemetry with privacy controls
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Configurable retention policies

## Compliance

The PEAC Protocol aims to comply with:
- OWASP API Security Top 10
