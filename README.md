## A Universal Policy Layer for the Automated Economy

PEAC (Programmable Economic Access, Attribution & Consent) Protocol is an open standard that enables content creators, publishers, and automated systems to negotiate access, payments, and compliance programmatically. Building on proven web standards, PEAC establishes a machine-readable policy file (peac.txt) that works alongside existing infrastructure.

## What is PEAC Protocol?

PEAC Protocol provides a standardized framework for:

- Programmable access control and consent management
- Automated micropayments for content usage
- Verifiable attribution chains
- Regulatory compliance automation

The protocol addresses the growing need for fair value exchange between content creators and AI systems, while ensuring compliance with global regulations.

## Why PEAC Protocol?

As automated systems increasingly interact with web content, the need for programmable policies becomes critical. PEAC enables:

- **Publishers & Creators**: Enable fair monetization and attribution terms for content access
- **Automated Agents (AI, Bots & Crawlers)**: Access content legally with clear terms
- **Platforms & Infrastructure**: Automate compliance and reduce legal risk
- **End-Users**: Transparent data usage and privacy protection
- **Developers**: Build compliant integrations with SDK tools
- **Regulators & Compliance Teams**: Transparent audit trails and policy enforcement

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install PEAC CLI
npm install -g @peacprotocol/core

# Create your peac.txt
npx peac init

# Validate configuration
npx peac validate peac.txt

# Deploy to your domain
# Upload peac.txt to your-domain.com/peac.txt
```

## Basic peac.txt Example

```yaml
# peac.txt - Define your content usage policies
version: 0.9.2
protocol: peac

policy:
  consent:
    ai_training: conditional
    web_scraping: allowed

  economics:
    pricing_models:
      ai_training:
        per_gb: 0.01
        currency: USD

  attribution:
    required: true
    format: "Source: {url}"

  compliance:
    jurisdictions:
      eu:
        gdpr: true
        ai_act: true
```

## Integration Examples

### For Publishers

```javascript
const { Parser } = require("@peacprotocol/core");

// Parse and enforce policies
const policy = await Parser.parse("example.com");

// Validate agent access
if (policy.requiresPayment("ai_training")) {
  // Handle payment flow
}
```

### For AI Agents

```javascript
const { PEACClient } = require("@peacprotocol/core");

const client = new PEACClient();
const access = await client.requestAccess("publisher.com", {
  purpose: "ai_training",
  volume: "10GB",
});

if (access.granted) {
  // Proceed with compliant access
}
```

## Use Cases

| Scenario                | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open Research Bot       | Non-commercial bot with consent/attribution, no payment |
| Attribution Enforcement | Require visible credit for content used in AI or bots   |
| AI Data Licensing       | Licensed access with tiered terms and basic negotiation |
