# PEAC Protocol Governance

## Current Status

PEAC Protocol is currently in early development under the stewardship of its founding contributors. As the project grows, we are committed to establishing open governance that represents all stakeholders.

## Governance Principles

1. **Openness**: Development happens in public repositories
2. **Transparency**: Decisions are documented and communicated
3. **Merit**: Contributions are valued based on quality and impact
4. **Inclusivity**: All voices are welcome and considered

## Current Structure

### Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Releasing new versions
- Guiding technical direction
- Ensuring code quality

Current maintainers are listed in the MAINTAINERS file.

### Contributors

Anyone can contribute by:

- Submitting pull requests
- Reporting issues
- Improving documentation
- Participating in discussions

## Decision Making

Currently, decisions are made through:

1. GitHub issue discussions
2. Pull request reviews
3. Maintainer consensus

For major changes:

- Proposals should be documented in issues
- Allow time for community feedback
- Document decisions and rationale

## Future Governance

As PEAC Protocol matures, we plan to:

1. Establish a technical steering committee
2. Create working groups for specific areas
3. Implement a formal RFC process
4. Consider foundation or consortium structure

The transition to formal governance will be driven by:

- Community growth
- Adoption milestones
- Stakeholder needs

## Contributing to Governance

We welcome input on governance evolution:

- Propose governance improvements via GitHub issues
- Share examples from other successful projects
