# PEAC Protocol Governance

Non-profit foundation (inspired by Let's Encrypt) with multi-stakeholder board including publishers, AI firms, infrastructure providers, OSS representatives, and regulators (e.g., IETF/W3C). Funded via grants and 0.1% transaction fees to prevent capture and ensure neutrality.

Contribution Policies:
- PRs reviewed by board/community.
- Code of Conduct: Standard OSS (e.g., Contributor Covenant).
- Decisions: Consensus-based for major changes.
