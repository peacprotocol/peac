### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

- Consent management
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Compliance Declaration

```yaml
version: 0.9.2
protocol: peac

policy:
  compliance:
    jurisdictions:
      eu:
        gdpr: true
        ai_act: true
      us:
        ccpa: true
```

### Consent with Purpose Limitation

```yaml
policy:
  consent:
    ai_training: denied
    analytics: allowed
    academic_research: allowed

  compliance:
    jurisdictions:
      eu:
        gdpr: true
        lawful_basis: consent
```

### Attribution for Transparency

```yaml
policy:
  attribution:
    required: true
    format: "AI training data from {url}"
    verification_endpoint: /verify-usage

  compliance:
    audit_log: true
    retention_period: P1Y # 1 year
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Purpose Definition

- Specify allowed use cases explicitly
- Use standard terminology where possible
- Avoid ambiguous terms

### 2. Audit Trail

- Log access requests
- Maintain attribution records
- Enable verification endpoints

### 3. Regular Updates

- Review policies periodically
- Update for new regulations
- Document policy changes

### 4. Transparency

- Make policies easily discoverable
- Use clear, plain language
- Provide contact information

## Common Patterns

### News Publisher (EU)

```yaml
policy:
  consent:
    ai_training: conditional
    web_indexing: allowed

  economics:
    pricing_models:
      ai_training:
        per_article: 0.10
        currency: EUR

  compliance:
    jurisdictions:
      eu:
        gdpr: true
        ai_act: true
        publisher_rights: true
```

### Healthcare Data (US)

```yaml
policy:
  consent:
    default: denied
    healthcare_research: conditional

  compliance:
    jurisdictions:
      us:
        hipaa: true
        ccpa: true
    requirements:
      - baa_required: true
      - audit_log: true
```

## Verification

Publishers can implement verification endpoints to prove compliance:

```yaml
policy:
  compliance:
    verification_endpoints:
      audit_log: /api/compliance/audit
      consent_status: /api/compliance/consent
      data_requests: /api/compliance/requests
```
