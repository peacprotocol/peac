# PEAC Protocol Compliance Mappings

PEAC ensures legal/ethical alignment for all agents.

- EU AI Act: Provenance via cryptographic logs/attribution; consent for data access.
- DMCA: Safe harbor through verifiable attribution/denials.
- GDPR: Consent-based terms; privacy in extensions (e.g., ZK proofs).
- Other: Mappings to India DPDP (data protection), China PIPL (personal info), and W3C Verifiable Credentials.

## Dispute Resolution Guidance

PEAC does not enforce disputes on-chain but enables verifiable logs for resolution.

Suggested practices:

- Agents store pricing_proof + attribution headers.
- Publishers expose contact email (already supported).
- Foundation may offer optional arbitration in v1.1+ via public GitHub repo or neutral process.

Disclaimers: Not legal advice; consult experts for deployment.
