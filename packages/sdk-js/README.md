# PEAC Protocol

> Pronounced “peak protocol”

**PEAC (Programmable Economic Access, Attribution & Consent)** is a protocol for specifying, enforcing, and negotiating access rules between AI agents, crawlers, publishers, and web services. It allows you to define access conditions in a human-readable and machine-enforceable file: `pricing.txt`. PEAC is an open, neutral protocol for consent, compliance, and commerce on the web.

## Features

- Define access terms using `pricing.txt` or `.well-known/peac.json`
- Enforce attribution, signature, tiered pricing, sessions, and payments
- Compatible with Stripe, x402, EIP-712
- Local SDK and CLI for validation, signing, and enforcement

## 📁 Examples

- [`examples/pricing.txt`](examples/pricing.txt) – baseline
- [`examples/full-pricing.txt`](examples/full-pricing.txt) – with sessions, tiers, attribution, expiry
- [`examples/minimal-pricing.txt`](examples/minimal-pricing.txt) – deny-all default

## Getting Started

1. Add a pricing.txt at your domain root with:
   protocol: peac
   version: 0.9
2. Install the SDK: npm install @peac/protocol
3. Use in code: const peac = require('@peac/protocol')

## Protocol Summary

PEAC Protocol defines a standardized, programmable layer for verifiable access to web content; enabling fair terms, attribution, and pricing between publishers and agents (human, AI, bot, or M2M). It introduces a human-readable `pricing.txt` , verifiable agent identity, and HTTP-based enforcement patterns that support differential access and micropayments. Compatible with x402-style enforcement via HTTP 402 status codes.

* Open by design: Machine-readable terms, consent-based access, attribution conditions, and auditability.
* Programmable & modular: Supports sessions, units, pricing tiers, signatures, and dispute metadata.
* Neutral infrastructure: Integrates with any CDN, server, or payment system via HTTP 402 and x402 primitives.

Goal: Sustain the open web with a global standard that is enforceable, interoperable, and fair; without paywalls, scraping wars, or platform lock-in.

## Why PEAC?

* Solves Market Failure: Addresses unpriced crawling with flexible pricing/attribution, preventing paywalls or splinternet.
* Key Differentiators: Simpler than x402 (human-writable terms), more open than proprietary solutions (e.g., Pay-Per-Crawl); enables differential access (free for research, paid for commercial).
* Adoption Flywheel: Start with publishers (easy pricing.txt), integrate infra (CDNs/APIs), scale to AI firms (legal data moats).
* Stakeholder Alignment: Publishers gain revenue/attribution; AI gets quality/compliant data; regulators ensure transparency (ties to EU AI Act 2025 provenance); invites W3C/IETF standardization.
* Governance: Non-profit foundation (inspired by Let's Encrypt) with multi-stakeholder board; fund via grants/0.1% fees to prevent capture.

PEAC is infrastructure-neutral and open-source by design: any publisher, platform, or agent can implement it without reliance on any vendor or payment rail.

## Discovery Fallback Order

| Priority | Location                  | Notes                  |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 1        | /pricing.txt              | Human-readable YAML    |
| 2        | /.well-known/peac.yaml    | Fallback               |
| 3        | /.well-known/peac.json    | Fallback               |
| 4        | Link header rel="peac-terms" | Redirect if present   |

## .peacrc Example

`.peacrc` (JSON) for overrides:

{
"method": "stripe",
"agent_id": "example-agent",
"user_id": "example-user",
"agent_type": "research",
"allowHttp": false,
"signing_method": "eip-712",
"enforce_attribution_log": false
}

## Stripe Payment Method Behavior

Stub-only for testing: Returns a redirect URL or pricing_proof URI. No real credentials or SDK used.

For real payments, extend handlePayment or use handlePaymentReal as example (with warning: integrate your own payment provider to maintain neutrality).

## Signature & Session Expiry

- Signatures: EIP-712 for verifiable identity.
- Sessions: Enforce expires_in (duration) or valid_until (ISO 8601); deny access if expired.

## CDN Integration Snippets

Example NGINX configuration for attribution enforcement:
location / {
if ($http_x_peac_attribution_consent != "true") {
return 402;
}
}

## Self-Hosted? Just Drop pricing.txt in Your Blog Root and Go

For individual bloggers or small sites, simply add pricing.txt to your root directory. No additional setup needed for basic enforcement.

## 🧰 SDK Usage (`core`)

You can use PEAC as a programmable access validator and policy enforcer in your server, crawler, or API agent.

```js
const {
  fetchPricing,
  checkAccess,
  handlePayment,
  signRequest,
  getTermsHash,
  validateAttribution,
  validateTiers
} = require('./core');

// 1. Fetch terms from a publisher
const terms = await fetchPricing('https://example.com');

// 2. Sign an access request using EIP-712
const privateKey = '0x...';
const request = {
  agent_id: '0xYourAddress',
  user_id: 'bot123',
  agent_type: 'research'
};
const signature = await signRequest(request, privateKey);

// 3. Verify access
const headers = {
  'X-PEAC-Agent-ID': request.agent_id,
  'X-PEAC-Signature': signature,
  'X-PEAC-Attribution-Consent': true
};
const access = checkAccess(terms, headers, { path: '/blog/article' });

console.log(access); // { access: true } or { access: false, reason: '...' }
```

## Verification

```bash
node -e "require('./core')"
npm test --prefix core
```
## Getting Started

0. **Review Spec**: See spec.md for identity, terms, and flows.
1. **Deploy pricing.txt**: Copy an example to your domain root (e.g., https://example.com/pricing.txt). Fallback to .well-known/peac.json supported.
2. **Integrate**:
   * Publishers: Add to server/CDN (e.g., NGINX, Fastly, Vercel, or any CDN/middleware that supports HTTP headers).
   * Agents: Use core SDK or HTTP clients with sigs (EIP-712/DID/mTLS).
   * Validate: Run CI workflow or AJV locally.
3. **Test**: Simulate with curl (e.g., signed requests); expect HTTP 402 for paid.

Example curl with attribution:
curl -H "X-PEAC-Attribution-Consent: true" \
     -H "X-PEAC-Attribution-URL: https://example.com/credit" \
     https://example.com/content

## Appendix: The Web's Unpriced Engine

Problem: AI crawling creates unpriced externalities, breaking HTTP assumptions of human-scale requests.

Primitives: Verifiable identity (EIP-712/DID/mTLS), machine-readable terms (pricing.txt), auditable accounting (logs).

Economics: Differential pricing (premium content higher), usage-based licensing (align costs with value), collective bargaining (cooperatives for rates), quality premiums (fact-checked earns more).
