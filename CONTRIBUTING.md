# Contributing to PEAC Protocol

Contribute to build the fair automated web. Welcoming devs, AI firms, publishers, and foundations.

PEAC is governed by open, transparent, and auditable contribution practices, welcoming diverse contributors across technical and non-technical domains.

Fork the repo, work in a dev branch, and submit PRs for review. All code, documentation, and protocol changes are tracked and auditable for transparency and trust.

Guidelines:

- Follow spec.md for features.
- Add tests for SDK changes.
- Use PR templates (issue description, code review checklist).
- Focus on modularity, neutrality, and compliance.

### PEAC Protocol Test Agent for EIP-712

All EIP-712 protocol integration tests use this public Ethereum test vector:

- agent_id: `0xa0fb98a1d397d13fbe71f31fbc3241c8b01488da`
- private_key: `4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113b37d7b1b6b5ddf49f7f6ed15`

This allows all contributors and auditors to run and verify protocol tests using reproducible, non-secret keys.

Paths: Spec writer (update spec.md), SDK dev (peac-core), Policy author (examples).

Please read and follow [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) before submitting.
